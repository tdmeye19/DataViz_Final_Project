Maddox Ormiston: Creating a leaflet on data from her SYE, and then pairing that with a Shiny app. Her Shiny app plot is not clear yet, however, she wants to create a plot with Time compared to one of the maternity hospital data variables. Her next step, which she already might have completed, is merging the hospital data with the latitude-longitude data. She will possibly add tabs to the Shiny app, she is just not sure what the tabs would be.

She wants to add a summary statistics table with the number of players, along with mean, max, min for the year that the user chooses. She wants to change the layout of her app because some of the values are getting cut off in the viewer window.
