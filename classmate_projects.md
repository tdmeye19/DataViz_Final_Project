Maddox Ormiston: Creating a leaflet on data from her SYE, and then pairing that with a Shiny app. Her Shiny app plot is not clear yet, however, she wants to create a plot with Time compared to one of the maternity hospital data variables. Her next step, which she already might have completed, is merging the hospital data with the latitude-longitude data. She will possibly add tabs to the Shiny app, she is just not sure what the tabs would be.
