Maddox Ormiston: Creating a leaflet on data from her SYE, and then pairing that with a Shiny app. Her Shiny app plot is not clear yet, however, she wants to create a plot with Time compared to one of the maternity hospital data variables. Her next step, which she already might have completed, is merging the hospital data with the latitude-longitude data. She will possibly add tabs to the Shiny app, she is just not sure what the tabs would be.

Alyssa Bigness: Creating a shiny app using MLB salary data. She is having trouble with an error, and she, along with the people she has asked, have no idea how to fix it. She wants to add a summary statistics table with the number of players, along with mean, max, min for the year that the user chooses. She wants to change the layout of her app because some of the values are getting cut off in the viewer window.

Nick Grammas: He is creating a blogdown post about real estate in Boston. He has different variables that he is plotting against each other, and using formula to calculate important real estate values that he can use to help someone get a better idea of properties in their price range. He wants to/might have started creating a map where the user can zoom in to see potential properties in different neighborhoods.

Kaden Pickering: He is creating a shiny app about NHL data for games going back to the 2008 season. He wants to be able to add more than tab, and have the input team affect each tab in the app. He needs to look to see if he can come up with more hypotheses for each tab, and then he can decide what output would go in each tab.

Charlie Reinhardt: He is creating an R package that scrapes hockey data from the ECAC website. He has it so that he can get individuals' team data now. His last step is that he needs to decide whether to use a for loop or create a function that will allow him to pull some data. He has functions to create plots for variables and teams, and just needs to continue working on scraping the data.

## April 18

Shane Hauck: He is creating a Shiny app with data from the Premier League. He had a problem with merging data sets where the names for each of the players did not line up, so he had to manually recode all of them. He is now working on possibly comparing players stats in terms of 90 minutes or one game.

## April 25

Grace Wysocki: She is creating a blogdown for data from California relating to cities and chemical levels. She has a leaflet that shows a subset of the data, and gives population and levels of the chemical. She wants to create a map, but is struggling with those steps.

## April 27

Caleb Hamblen: He is creating a Shiny app for PGA golf data, and now he is focusing on possibly comparing players expected statistics compared to what they actually scored. He also is trying to fix the formatting of some of his plots and his app in general, with one of the plots showing up in the side panel rather than the main panel.
