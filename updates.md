I created some plots using the statsfull, changed the statistic variables to numeric instead of character. Then, I tried to solve the issue with the Rank variable, and how to have a value take the last non-NA value before that, but could not figure out how to put the new data in the Rank column.

Over the weekend I included conferences, and added the team value data set, which I have yet to put into a tab on the app. I had trouble figuring out how to have someone see the conference table only.
